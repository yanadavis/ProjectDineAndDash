Part 1
A budgeting application which, in addition to providing a way to keep track of one’s finances, lets users scan receipts and maintain these records in their phones, allowing for an easy, convenient and real-time way to manage their money.

1.	The problem
We recognize that budgeting is important for personal financial management, but for some of us, manually entering each transaction is inconvenient and too time-consuming. While over 30 million receipts are printed each day in the UK alone , these small, flimsy pieces of paper are often accumulated in a pile, which is then discarded at the earliest convenience. Given the presence of modern technology capable of extracting text from images , automating the process of recording one’s expenditures can provide the motivation to track spending for those of us who find the currently available process too troublesome.

2.	The users 
The users often purchase things in public and want to keep track of their spending to see if they are meeting self-assigned budget goals. They do not want to eliminate the expenses that bring them pleasure, but recognize that they may be spending too much on Skinny Vanilla Lattes. 

This application allows a person to set a goal (monthly, weekly, or annual) after tracking his or her expenses for a month—or, for an experienced user, the goal can be set immediately. Any number of categories can be monitored, from food and entertainment to recurring monthly bills. There is no penalty for overspending, because goals are their ideals, not necessarily reality. Instead, spending less is rewarded. Users can connect the application to a wish list, and they will be notified when they accumulate enough spending power to buy the items they want to have, but cannot justify or afford.

3.	The situations
The need for this app arises in everyday transactions. For example, a mother goes grocery shopping at several stores with her child. She wants to keep track of the plethora of receipts she's about to receive before they pile up, all while keeping an eye on the child. This app would provide a swift method of recording and organizing the receipts while also doing the arithmetic required at the end of the day. Another example is when a group has finished dining at a restaurant. Normally, the receipt wouldn't be taken at all, resulting in the amount spent forgotten. In any transaction, from renting a bike to visiting Disneyland to buying Oreo cookies and milk at 3 o’clock in the morning, it saves the user the tedious task of going through a stack of receipts and manually categorizing and summing them together.

4.	Usability goals 
This application adds efficiency to expense tracking, since a user is one click away from recording the necessary metadata about a transaction, including date, amount, and the type of expense (where applicable). Since we hope to further the budgeting appeal to those who may not already use similar software, we want to ensure that data can be entered and retrieved quickly. We expect the user to be always ‘on the go,’ with no interest to spend a lot of time learning and using the application per transaction.

The user can maintain the record of spending on the device, or discard the receipt image without saving if privacy is a concern. This eliminates the need to provide personal banking passwords, ensuring higher safety and effectiveness.

Our application provides excellent utility, because users may want to do many things with a budget, such as setting goals, recording transactions, and displaying an overview of their spending for a given time period. All these uses will be addressed and within each, there will be flexibility so that users can view the information in a way that suits them. 
5.	User experience goals 
The primary barrier in applications with similar functionality is how the user feels when using it regularly. Keying in numbers and sorting out categories can easily become tedious, producing a repulsive user experience, even frustrating when in a hurry. However, much of the chore can be bypassed by automatically scanning the receipts. Sorting them can also be streamlined to a few taps on the screen. Once the tedium has been taken out, what's left is a tidy and organized list of expenditures, as well as simple and clear graphs to view the progress. 

More importantly, by letting the users focus on the positives (saving) rather than the negatives (overspending), and allowing them to reward themselves with the extra cash, we hope to set a standard for a more motivating and fulfilling experience.
